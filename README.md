# PodiesRedesign
Redesign of the Podies Team's Website

The team leader asked me to redesign the old Podies Website, so that it could look more creative and full of life.
I created graphics based on the core features, characteristics and nature of Podies. I converted those into SVGs and have tried incorporating them into the website.

Thanks!
